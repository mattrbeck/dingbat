# Playtest bug investigations

Bugs the cross-emulator playtest harness (tools/playtest) found in dingbat,
with the investigation state of each. Newest notes at the bottom of each
section; a section marked FIXED names its commit.

## 1. Sonic Advance 1 + 2 hang on grey bars at boot

**Cause (proven 2026-09-16):** RCNT is 0 after the skip-BIOS boot. The real
BIOS leaves it in general-purpose mode (bit 15 set); mGBA initialises it to
0x8000. With RCNT = 0x8000 forced at skip-boot, dingbat's Sonic Advance
frames are hash-identical to mGBA's from frame 60 on. dingbat's real-BIOS
boot (`--run-bios`) already worked: the BIOS writes RCNT itself.

Ruled out: the RCNT pin readout (bits 0-3 in multiplay mode read 0xF in
dingbat, 0x0 in mGBA; forcing 0 changed nothing).

Hardware question: which post-boot I/O values does the skip-BIOS path still
get wrong? tests/roms/bootio.gba dumps every I/O word at ROM entry plus
RCNT/SIOCNT write-readback experiments (see that file's header).

**FIXED:** the skip-BIOS boot now leaves RCNT = 0x800F, the value dingbat's
real-BIOS path produces. Sonic Advance and Sonic Advance 2 playtests PASS
(play identical to mGBA, saves cross-load). Sonic Advance 2's save still
differs from mGBA's in 28 bytes (3 ranges): not yet examined.

First emulator runs of bootio.gba (dingbat skip-BIOS vs dingbat real BIOS vs
mGBA), open-bus words aside:
- the skip-BIOS boot also differs from dingbat's real-BIOS boot in SOUNDCNT_H
  (0 vs 0x000E) and wave RAM (FF00 vs 0000 per word) and TM0's counter;
- RCNT data nibble: dingbat keeps what is written (80F5 reads 80F5), mGBA
  never stores it (reads 80F0);
- RCNT pins in normal/multi/UART/JOY modes: dingbat 5/F/F/C, mGBA 0;
- SIODATA32_L / SIOMULTI2 written in normal 8-bit mode: dingbat reads 0,
  mGBA reads the value back.
The hardware pages settle each of these.

## 2. Save state with a game-set clock fails to load (RangeDefect)

Rockman EXE 4.5 sets its clock to 2006, earlier than the harness's source
clock, so the RTC bias is negative. The writer wrapped it into a u64
silently; the reader's checked `int64(u64)` conversion raised. **FIXED** with
casts on both sides; tests/gba_rtc_test.nim covers a negative bias. The bias
code is only on this branch, so no shipped state is affected.

## 3. Rockman EXE 4.5 never saves (SRAM picked over FLASH512)

Library census (7906 ROMs, save-library strings): ROMs naming more than one
library are Medabots AX / Medarot G (EEPROM+FLASH), Kim Possible (J) / Kim
Possible 2 / Ueki no Housoku (EEPROM+FLASH512), Breath of Fire (J) / Super
Monkey Ball Jr (EEPROM+FLASH+SRAM), One Piece - Mezase! King of Paris
(SRAM+FLASH), Rockman EXE 4.5 (SRAM+FLASH512), Top Gun (all but EEPROM).
Save-memory writes logged over a minute of boot/menus in dingbat:
- Rockman 4.5: flash ID command only, then waits on flash (mGBA pins BR4J to
  FLASH512 + RTC).
- One Piece: flash ID command, then SRAM writes when no flash answers (with
  flash it erases/programs flash; mGBA autodetects flash from that command).
- Medabots, Kim Possible 2, Monkey Ball Jr: EEPROM first (dingbat's EEPROM
  pick matches). Ueki: flash ID then EEPROM (mGBA pins EEPROM; unchanged).
- Breath of Fire (J): no save access in that minute; unchanged (EEPROM).
**FIXED:** SRAM + a flash library without EEPROM -> that flash type
(storage.nim); tests/savestate_compat_test.nim covers the pairs.
(the harness's saves.py rom_info mirrors it). Rockman EXE 4.5 playtest now PASS: dingbat saves, all 9 cross-loads work, 9 bytes differ from mGBA's save.

## 4. Random outcomes differ on identical input frames (Yu-Gi-Oh! 2004 deck)

Not an RNG bug: a boot-timing phase. Method (tools in the session scratch,
recipe here): replay identical input in dingbat and mGBA, peek the game's
RNG seed (IWRAM 0x03000040) every frame. The sequences are identical; the
seed advances once per game frame, but dingbat reaches frame-13's value one
frame later than mGBA and stays one frame behind. The lag comes from a
per-frame count of TM0 IRQ bursts (TM0 reload 0xFCE2 = 798 cycles, 16
overflows per burst; 22 bursts per 280896-cycle frame exactly) taken in
the vblank path: dingbat counts 21, mGBA 22 -- the timer phase straddles
the snapshot.

Two causes found:
1. **Skip-BIOS video phase** (FIXED 9a3c7b7cd, test runner unchanged): dingbat started
   the PPU on line 0 at ROM entry; its own LLE BIOS boot hands over on line
   126, 838 cycles in (mGBA's skip-boot also uses line 126). TM0 phase vs
   mGBA at each frame boundary went from 367 to ~23 cycles. bootio.gba's
   VCOUNT word (0x006) photographs the hardware value.
2. **~50 cycles of ROM-access cost** between instruction 82,600 and the TM0
   enable at instruction 83,772 (dingbat vs mGBA cycle counts per
   instruction agree to +-2 before that). Too fine to call without
   hardware; the deck still differs. Left as is.

Side note: dingbat's harness frame 1 can end mid-frame when the boot halts
across two vblanks inside one CPU step (step_frame exits with frame=2); the
count realigns by frame 3.

After the phase fix the Yu-Gi-Oh! 2004 and Mario Golf AT playtests PASS on
their checkpoints, but their saves still differ from BOTH references (107
and 4 bytes): the deck/values are still one frame off. Harvest Moon FoMT
still FAILs at farm_intro (not traced; note early-frame RAM peeks in dingbat
are unreliable because of the frame-1 quirk above).
Probe commands added to the playtest drivers for this: mGBA `busread16 A`,
`stepn N`, `stepuntil A MASK` (single-steps, reports the master clock);
dingbat `layers MASK`. Instruction-level cycle comparison recipe: step both
N instructions from boot and diff dingbat `scheduler.cycles` vs mGBA
`mTimingGlobalTime` (a Nim tool that ticks the CPU; do not poll I/O between
ticks, bus reads cost cycles).

## 5. Boktai: "Solar Sensor is broken."

**FIXED:** GPIO solar sensor for game codes U3I* / U32* / U33* (gpio.nim,
GBATEK "GBA Cart Solar Sensor"): bit 1 resets a counter, bit 0 rising edges
count, bit 3 reads 1 once the counter reaches `solar_level` (default 0xE8 =
no sunlight). Verified: with the sensor removed the message appears at frame
~4476 of the scripted run; with it the intro continues. tests/gba_rtc_test.nim
covers dark/bright measurements. **Open:** no frontend control yet for
`gpio.solar_level` (desktop/web), so the in-game sun gauge stays at zero.

## 6. Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones, one-step colour on two menus

Not resolved. At select_mode BLDCNT=0x3C42 (BG1 over BG2/BG3/OBJ/BD),
BLDALPHA=0x030D (13+3). dingbat's pixels differ from both references on
~12k pixels, mostly 1-3 steps darker, some white pixels 29 vs 31 -- more
than blend truncation explains, so a layer input (BG1/BG2 content or frame
phase of the animated fog) differs. The references agree with each other
though their checkpoint frames differ by 5. The verdict itself came from OCR
noise on the text. mGBA's enableVideoLayer segfaults in the headless build,
so a per-layer comparison needs another route (dump BG1/BG2 tile+palette
state in both at the same frame).
