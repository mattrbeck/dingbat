  # Boot-state model. Selects the per-hardware-revision CPU register / DIV
  # seed table applied at the boot-ROM handoff (skip_boot). Real users only
  # ever get bmDmgABC (any DMG/SGB cart) or bmCgbABCDE (any CGB cart) — those
  # reproduce the values dingbat has always used. The other variants exist so
  # the mooneye boot_regs-*/boot_div-* acceptance ROMs (which each target one
  # specific hardware revision) can be driven by the test harness via --model.
  # Sources: mooneye-test-suite acceptance/misc boot_regs-*.s / boot_div-*.s

  # The three buses an OAM DMA can own, and that a CPU access can collide with.
  # Pan Docs "OAM DMA bus conflicts" states the separation for the CGB
  # ("the cartridge and WRAM are on separate buses"), and the memory map plus
  # the PPU's dedicated video bus (Pan Docs "Accessing VRAM and OAM") give the

# The share of the output's -1..1 range given to one channel's DAC (get_sample).
#
# The mixer adds up to four DAC outputs, each spanning -1..1, so one side of the
# mix spans -4..4 (Pan Docs, Audio Details: "the analog range of those outputs
# is 4x that of each channel"). Nothing in the hardware pins that to a host's
# full scale -- there is an amplifier and a volume knob in between -- so this is
# a headroom decision, and it is made by the DC blocker downstream.
#
# The blocker emits `mix - cap`, where the stored charge tracks the mix's local
# MEAN. Both terms are independently bounded by the mixer range, so the output
# can reach twice it. That is not a corner case here: a channel that is switched
# off but whose DAC is still powered parks at analog +1 (see GB_DAC_LUT), so the
# mean genuinely does sit near a rail for long stretches, and a waveform
# excursion to the other rail then spans the full 2x. At 1/4 -- what the mixer
# used before the DC blocker existed, where a full-scale mix was exactly
# full-scale output -- that clips. 1/8 makes overflow arithmetically impossible:
# |mix| <= 1/2 and |cap| <= 1/2, so |out| <= 1.

# Output-stage DC blocker.
#
# A Game Boy channel's DAC does not idle at the middle of its range: the 4-bit
# digital value 0 is one RAIL, not silence (see GB_DAC_LUT). A 12.5%-duty square
# therefore sits at the top of its swing seven eighths of the time, and a
# channel that is switched off but still has its DAC powered sits there
# permanently. So the mixer's output carries a large DC component that moves
# every time a DAC is powered up or down, or panning or master volume changes.
# Measured on 60 s of in-game audio, the raw mix sits at 0.85 full scale in
# Link's Awakening DX and pins against a rail for a quarter of all samples.
#
# The hardware couples the mixer to the output jack through a capacitor, which
# removes that offset. Without it every one of those DC shifts reaches the
# speaker as a step, and a step is what a listener hears as a click. This is the
# standard one-pole model: the capacitor charges toward the input, and only the
# difference is passed on.
#
#     out = in - cap;   cap = in - out * charge
#
# `charge` is per output sample, so it is the per-T-cycle constant raised to the
# number of T-cycles between samples: 0.999958 ** (GB_CLOCK_SPEED / rate). At
# 32768 Hz that is 0.9946383, a 28 Hz corner with a 5.7 ms time constant --
# below anything the APU can play, so it removes offset and nothing else.
#
