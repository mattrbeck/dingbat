# MP2K HLE archive sweep

2354 deduplicated ROMs (one per title from a 7,899-ROM archive; bad dumps and multiboot
conversions skipped), each booted 900 frames headless with the shadow HLE armed
(`tests/mp2k_sweep.nim` via `tools/mp2k_sweep.py`), span-matched HLE-vs-REAL DirectSound
RMS captured per run. The raw per-ROM results are no longer kept; these are the totals.

- **before the fix batch**: ok 2354/2354, crashes 0, timeouts 0; m4a-positive 1033,
  engaged 1013 (98.1%); music-playing engaged 808, within ±20% 689 (85.3%), median ratio 0.952
- **after** (foreign-feeder fallback, VSyncOff idents, FIFO DMA level-conditioned grants,
  attack frames, decimation backfill, ct position resync): ok 2354/2354; engaged 1013
  (98.1%), foreign-latched 75; music-playing engaged 738, within ±20% 724 (98.1%),
  median ratio 1.037

## 2026-09-13: the rewritten HLE, then the probe-driven restructure

The mixer had been rewritten from scratch (provenance audit). Re-swept as found and after
restructuring it on the probe-ROM facts (tools/mp2kprobe/README.md), 2354 titles, 900 frames:

| | as found | restructured |
|---|---|---|
| crashes / timeouts | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 |
| m4a present / engaged | 1033 / 1014 | 1033 / 1014 |
| music-playing engaged | 780 | 780 |
| within ±20 % loudness | 773 (99.1 %) | 773 (99.1 %) |
| median loudness ratio | 0.995 | 0.966 |
| median envelope correlation (100 ms RMS) | 0.993 | 0.995 |

No title moved out of the ±20 % band; Wings (U) moved in (1.33 → 1.09). The loudness
median dropped because the exact 2 × side/256 gain replaced a fitted 2.025 makeup and
killed channels no longer sound for a frame. The same seven titles sit outside the band as
in July (Breath of Fire 1.46, Van Helsing 0.70, Beast Shooter 0.74, Kawaii Koinu 0.77,
SMT II 0.78, Ochaken 0.79, Estopolis 0.79) and stay unexplained.

The RMS ratio cannot see waveform errors. Against the driver's own pcmBuffer (tests/
mp2k_probe.nim, Emerald title screen, per-frame correlation at the driver's sample
instants) the as-found HLE scored 0.47 over the run; the restructured one has a per-frame
median of 0.988 with 90 % of frames above 0.95.

## Why span-matched

`-d:mp2kwav` (`src/dingbat/gba/apu.nim`) gates the REAL FIFO capture on the same
predicate as the HLE render, so a run's HLE and REAL RMS cover the same audio span. Games
whose engine engages late (Mother 3 holds `SoundInfo.ident` at ID_NUMBER+10 through a
~10 s intro) otherwise pad REAL with leading silence and make the HLE read ~+23% hot when
the matched streams agree within a few percent.
